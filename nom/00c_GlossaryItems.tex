\addglossaryitem{rollsteer}{Roll steer}{The tendency for a non-steered axle to exhibit some steering when a vehicle rolls on its axis. This is due to the movement of the wheels not being purely vertical as the springs deflect, resulting in one axle moving slightly forward while the other moves slightly back, creating an element of steer.}
