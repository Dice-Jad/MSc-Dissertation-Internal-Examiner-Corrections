I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Frank Kienh{\"o}fer for his continued direction and support during this research and for his guidance in my journey to becoming an accredited PBS assessor in South Africa.

I would like to thank Robert Berman (acting co-supervisor), Christopher de Saxe, Anton Steenkamp, and Lana Kemp who form the team led by Dr. Paul Nordengen at the \gls{csir} for their support, guidance and critical role in the development of \gls{pbs} in South Africa. Their dedication to improving the safety and cost of transport in South Africa is inspiring.

I am truly grateful to my mom, dad, and brother who were there for me regardless of the hour providing love, support and guidance.

I am eternally thankful to Jesus Christ my Lord and saviour whose love, grace and mercy is with me always.
