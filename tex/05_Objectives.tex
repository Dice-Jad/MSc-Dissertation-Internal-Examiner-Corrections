\chapter{Objectives}\label{section:objectives}

The objective of this MSc dissertation is to quantify the relative effect of each \gls{vdp} of a multi-body vehicle dynamics model on the vehicle safety as measured using the \gls{pbs} framework that has been adopted in South Africa for three commonly used \gls{hcv} designs.

Achieving this objective is important as it will provide guidance as to which \glspl{vdp} can be safely estimated in the absence of definitive data when evaluating the \gls{pbs} performance of a \gls{hcv} and provide guidance as to the critical \glspl{vdp} which need to be accurately estimated to predict representative vehicle safety of a \gls{hcv}. Furthermore, it will provide insight into which \glspl{vdp} should be focussed on when attempting to improve a vehicles performance for a performance measure within the \gls{pbs} framework.
