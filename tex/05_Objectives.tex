\chapter{Objectives}\label{section:objectives}

The objectives of this MSc dissertation are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Quantify the relative effect of pertinent \glspl{vdp} of a multi-body vehicle dynamics model on the vehicle safety as measured using the \gls{pbs} framework currently being used in South Africa for three commonly used \gls{hcv} designs.
\item Develop easy-to-use look-up tables displaying the relative effect of each of the evaluated \glspl{vdp} on each of the \gls{pbs} performance measures for vehicle designers and \gls{pbs} assessors to use in vehicle design, optimisation and \gls{pbs} vehicle data acquisition.
\item Highlight interesting observations from the results and discuss their implications for the \gls{pbs} initiative in South Africa and globally.
\end{enumerate}

Achieving these objectives is important as it will provide guidance as to which \glspl{vdp} can be safely estimated in the absence of definitive data when evaluating the \gls{pbs} performance of a \gls{hcv} and provide guidance as to the critical \glspl{vdp} which need to be accurately estimated to predict representative vehicle safety of a \gls{hcv}. Furthermore, it will provide insight into which \glspl{vdp} should be focused on when attempting to improve a vehicles performance for a performance measure within the \gls{pbs} framework.
